            "No second thoughts. Best performance and smooth touch. After 10 days of use, feels like working with masterpiece machine. Best performance. Little costly but worth it once you start using.",

            "If you have a macbook air from 2019 or any older model than that, upgrade to this. This also runs FCPX remarkably well. The screen size however is a disappointment for me. Go for 16 inches if you can afford."

            "I've been using the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 with AMD Ryzen 7 7435HS for a few weeks now, and I'm impressed by its raw power and features.

            "I was sort of worried about Amazon's delivery, but it turned out amazing! The product arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition.\nPerformance is outstanding without a doubt. For the price the 4050 is amazing. Although, min. of 8GB VRAM would have been appreciated but regardless, great deal. Minecraft (all settings max. render distance 16 and BSL shaders) gives 90 - 100 fps easily.\n\nWithout the iGPU, the battery life does suffer. With normal use (content, office apps etc), you could get around 3 - 4 hours of battery. Heads up: This comes with the big plug (the 16A one they use with ACs and microwaves, so you'd have to install a separate plug for it)\n\nThe speakers were so bad I couldn't stand using them for 3 minutes. Even with Dolby enabled, it didn't make much difference. I recommend using FxSound which is available on Microsoft Store and makes the speakers much better.\n\nThe top is made of metal and the overall build is very sturdy. Can't really hold it with one hand for too long but still lighter than flagship gaming laptops.\n\nDisplay is very good indoors but a nightmare outdoors. Colors are amazing on the display though.\nRead more",

            "I bought an Asus TUF GAMING 15 from amazon on 16/10/2024. After 5 days it had many problems (it suddenly shut down, I thought the battery must have run out, so I charged the laptop and turned it on (it turned on after 5 minutes and the battery was still 40%) and after 1 hour windows crashed and after 1 day windows crashed 3 times, and keyboard light is not working properly ,then I sent it for replacement and AMAZON people said that the tech technician would visit on 27/10/2024 but the technician did not come on the 27th, I contacted Amazon on 1st Nov, they said that your product will be refunded, the DELHIVERY agent will pick up your product on 2nd Nov, but they are not picked my product PLEASE REFUND ME MY MONEY\nRead more",
            "This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc...\nSound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful.\nHeating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card.\nCharing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a \"battery care mode\" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it. Appearance is nice for gamers and having aura blacklit sync!!\nThis review may be helpful for you about this laptop, it is worth as it has ryzen 7 7000 series as other laptops have most cost than this!!\nTop notch\n5/5 stars!!!",
            "Performance wise good but battery backup is very poor. If battery backup will increase it will be one among the best laptops.",

            "I've got the ryzen 3 5000 series 8gb variant in july 2024\n\nIt has been 2 days of using it\nThe built quality of my unit is intact,no damage or scratches so far since delivery\n\nComing from using IPS display in desktop and amoled in cellphone the screen quality of the laptop feels dull but knowing what i paid for and got,I'm ok with it. if anyone is planning to get this product they will get used to the display quality eventually\n\nI haven't installed anything yet and feel it's bit laggy but I'm ok with it,as I don't play games and will use it for online work and other productive work which don't require that much memory(although RAM can be extended in this model), people should go for the 16gb ram varient if availability of ryzen 3 5000 is there,under 31k or less\n\nBattery backup is about 3/4 hours of average usage, but more backup can be achieved according to usage patterns, adjusting screen brightness in a new unit as it gets older battery degradation will happen eventually as backup of the laptop\n\nWiFi is working fine so far, haven't tried bluetooth function yet\n\nSpeaker is of average quality but on softer side,what i felt\ncould have been a little louder\n\nKeyboard is without backlit and responsive, if you have big hands and fingers then it might be an issue(buy an external keyboard and mouse)like me and this will solve the inconvenience and longevity of keyboard and trackpad of laptop\n\nAll the ports and jack are working fine\n\nWhat i had seen in videos and reviews, i thought they will provide a 45watt charger but they have provided with 65 watt charger which charges quite fast, which is a plus point but still it takes about 2 hrs 10 min to fully charged from 7% to 100% in my case(with wifi/ bluetooth off and no apps running in background with 25 to 30% screen brightness)\n\nIt doesn't come with lifetime validity of MS office you have to buy after free trail period or find a cracked one from local computer stores\n\nOverall you can buy the laptop if you are in a budget with decent built,fast charging,full HD screen and average performance under 27000 then go for it,you can also get it under 25000 during sale seasons using bank cards and exchange offers\n\nIn future I will update my review or post a comment if something unusual things come by with the laptop\nRead more",
